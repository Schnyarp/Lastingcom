Sales & transfer process (recommended)
-------------------------------------
A typical, low‑risk process for buyer and seller:

1. Initial inquiry and negotiation by email.
2. Agree terms (price, timeline, escrow provider, transfer flow). A short Letter of Intent is optional.
3. Open an escrow for the transaction (recommended).
4. Buyer deposits funds into escrow.
5. Seller prepares domain for transfer:
   - Disable registrar lock;
   - Provide EPP/Auth code to buyer or escrow agent per escrow instructions;
   - Turn off WHOIS privacy if required by the escrow flow.
6. Buyer accepts the transfer at their registrar and confirms domain in escrow.
7. Escrow provider releases funds to seller after transfer confirmation and any agreed wait period.
8. Confirm DNS and nameserver settings; complete any post‑transfer steps.

Recommended escrow providers
----------------------------
- Escrow.com — widely used and recommended for domain transactions.  
- Sedo — marketplace with escrow options.  
- Reputable broker- or law-firm‑managed escrow (as mutually agreed).

Due diligence checklist for buyers
----------------------------------
Before purchase, perform these checks:

- WHOIS & ownership verification (request a current WHOIS snapshot).  
- Wayback / archive history: https://archive.org/web/  
- Backlink and SEO profile (Majestic, Ahrefs, SEMrush — request reports if available).  
- Traffic history (Google Analytics, Search Console screenshots if seller can provide) — if relevant to price.  
- Trademark search (USPTO, CIPO, EUIPO or other jurisdictions) for potential conflicts.  
- Brand/URL conflict searches across search engines, social platforms and app stores.  
- Email/hosting reputation and blacklist checks if domain was used to send mail.  
- UDRP risk assessment: look for trademark owners who could file disputes.  
- Registrar transfer lock and any domain transfer restrictions.

Technical notes for transfer
----------------------------
- Obtain the EPP/Auth code from the current registrar when ready to transfer.  
- Ensure the domain is unlocked and the admin email is reachable for transfer confirmations.  
- WHOIS privacy may need to be disabled for some escrow flows.  
- Decide whether the buyer will change nameservers immediately or after the transfer — coordinate to avoid downtime.

Assets included (as listed)
---------------------------
- index.html — public listing/landing page (sample listing for lasting.com).  
- No additional trademarks, logos or third‑party assets are included unless explicitly transferred and agreed.

Valuation notes & positioning
-----------------------------
- Single-word, category-relevant .com names typically command premium pricing.  
- Value depends on perceived commercial utility, keyword search volume, backlink profile, historical traffic and market demand.  
- Request a short valuation memo or traffic/key metrics when you inquire — some data may be provided on a per‑inquiry basis.

Privacy & legal
---------------
- Negotiations are confidential by default. If you require an NDA, state that in your inquiry.  
- Use an established escrow service and agreed transfer procedure to reduce fraud risk.  
- The seller provides ownership verification; buyers are responsible for trademark clearance and their own legal due diligence.
